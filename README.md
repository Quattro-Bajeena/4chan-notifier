# 4chan-notifier
python scripts that check if there are 4chan threads with specific keywords, on chosen boards.
Compare them with the previous check to find out if any of them are new.
Then send a notification about them through Pushover app.

# TODO:
- streamline configuration ex. searched boards and keywords in config files
- better configurability, ex. specify especific keywords for certain boards individually
- making it more standaolne, include script that or sth, that sets up running every x hours automatically
- as for this ^ maybe, even make it command line app? or like module?
- clean up logs, now there are two separete files in diferent locations
